outcome: PARTIAL_PLUS

goal: "Overnight polish: dashboard cleanup, table view, richer mission cards + stale mission triage"
now: "Interview session — regroup on War Room vision, what's actually useful, how chat/Shoin fits"
test: npm run build

done_this_session:
  - task: "Removed Mission Queue from dashboard — was overwhelming"
    files: [app/dashboard/page.tsx]
  - task: "Added proposal descriptions to mission queries"
    files: [lib/queries.ts, components/mission-kanban-card.tsx]
  - task: "Richer expanded mission cards (description, step summary, result summary)"
    files: [components/mission-kanban-card.tsx]
  - task: "Created MissionTableView — sortable table with 6 columns"
    files: [components/mission-table-view.tsx]
  - task: "Board/Table toggle on project detail (persists in localStorage)"
    files: [components/project-detail.tsx]
  - task: "Triaged 4 stale 'running' missions from migration"
    files: []
  - task: "Updated Pip briefing + clawd memory for overnight changes"
    files: [thoughts/shared/pip-briefing.md]
  - task: "Merged PR #3 (mission-first board + Tauri) and PR #4 (overnight polish)"
    files: []

blockers:
  - "Shoin Chat (Pip's work) has broken buttons and can't actually chat — needs rewrite or investigation"
  - "User is on the fence about War Room's value proposition — needs interview to clarify"

questions:
  - "Is War Room a monitoring dashboard, an action surface (chat with agents), or both?"
  - "Does kanban/table view fit Sensei's workflow or is it overhead?"
  - "What's the relationship between War Room dashboard and Shoin Chat?"
  - "Should Shoin Chat be a separate page or replace parts of the dashboard?"
  - "Vektor Chat (Riley's tweet) has canvas/artifact panel — is that what Sensei wants?"

decisions:
  - mission_first_board: "Projects now show missions (not tasks) in kanban — missions are the primary work unit"
  - mission_queue_removed: "Dashboard no longer shows Mission Queue — too overwhelming, missions live in projects"
  - stale_mission_triage: "2 missions → queued (Fix Channel Permissions, Leveling System), 2 → stale for review (War Room Integration, Level 2 Protocol)"

findings:
  - vektor_chat_reference: "Riley Ralmuto's Vektor Chat (x.com/rileyralmuto/status/2020980430154191287) — custom chat app with thread sidebar, streaming center panel, canvas/artifact right panel. Opus 4.6. Sensei wants something similar."
  - pip_shoin_chat_state: "Pip built Shoin Chat with Supabase Realtime, agent presence, voice recording, streaming. Schema at supabase/migrations/20250211_shoin_chat.sql. Build passes but buttons broken, can't chat. Handoff at thoughts/shared/handoffs/war-room-build/ from Pip."
  - overnight_agent_pattern: "5 parallel background agents completed all tasks in ~90s each. Sonnet model, bypass permissions. Type check + build verified after each group."

worked:
  - "Parallel agent groups (A then B) — fast, clean, all type-checked"
  - "Spec-driven delegation with acceptance criteria per task"
  - "Supabase REST API with service role key for mission status updates"

failed:
  - "Pip's Shoin Chat — shadcn/ui components installed but buttons non-functional, no actual chat capability"

next:
  - "Interview session: clarify War Room vision — monitoring vs action surface vs both"
  - "Decide Shoin Chat direction: fix Pip's work, rewrite from scratch, or different approach"
  - "Review 2 stale missions (War Room Integration, Level 2 Protocol) — user needs to decide status"
  - "Consider Vektor Chat-style canvas panel if that's what Sensei wants"
